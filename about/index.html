            <h2 id="activist">Activist</h2>
            <p>For the past fifteen months, I worked to actualize my principles in feminism, environmental stability, and social justice as part of the Hillary for America team. I performed a variety of roles across the country with the goal of electing the first female POTUS. My experiences in the Organizing Team culminated in seven months in Southern Ohio as a Regional Organizing Director, managing a team of seven organizers. Previously, I performed legal Opposition Research in courthouses across the West, covered 64 counties as an organizer in Western Kansas, and analyzed the effects of digital strategy as a data &amp; design fellow for the Digital Team in Iowa.</p>
            
            <h2 id="product-manager">Product Manager</h2>
            
            <p>In San Francisco, I was a core member of the small Product team at PaperG, a B2B creative management platform driving programmatic ad creation for agencies and brands, and the industry leader in automatic display ads for publishers. As a Product Manager I led cross-team research, design, and development around new features and customer satisfaction, focusing on our AI-fueled instant design technologies. The complex and emerging industry of ad technology and the environment of a fast-growing startup kept me fluent in research-driven decisions, flexibility, and leadership. Revenues more than doubled in my time at PaperG - millions of dollars in growth driven by entirely new products we developed for complex markets.</p>
            
            <h2 id="cognitive-science--design">Cognitive Science &amp; Design</h2>
            
            <p>At Yale, I dedicated my undergraduate studies to Cognitive Science with a focus on Design, AI, &amp; Computational Vision. Courses and opportunities outside my major allowed me to explore other interests in Computer Science, Design, Architecture, Language, and Philosophy. During this time, I worked as the Designer for the Yale Office of Sustainability, the President of Desing at Yale, and the ad hoc designer for a number of organizations, incorporating design thinking and graphics into both coursework and extracurriculars. I also spent a large portion of my time at Yale within Dwight Hall, the Center for Service &amp; Social Justice at Yale, leading efforts to combat hunger and homelessness in the New Haven community. My goal then and now is to combine technical &amp; design strengths with a desire to have a lasting positive impact on the world.</p>
            
            <h2 id="this-website">This Website</h2>
            <p>Everything on here, unless otherwise noted, is my own work - all photographs, design, and code. I built this site using Nanoc, a Ruby static site generator, with Haml templating &amp; Markdown. For a more updated design portfolio, contact me.</p>

            <h3 id="evolution-of-beauty">Evolution of Beauty</h3>
            
            <p>How do arbitrary choices lead to the development of an aesthetic? Richard Prum (Yale Ornithology) has proposed that the evolution of sexually and socially selected communication traits in birds (such as feather patterning and color) should be understood as a form of evolutionary aesthetics, which predicts the evolution of arbitrary standards of beauty among species. </p>
            
            <p>For my senior thesis and the summer following, I investigated this 'evolution of beauty' using a combination of avian color science and hyperspectral imaging. This involves two parts. First, I'm statistically mapping the dispersal of pigment &amp; structural color in the Cotingidae family, and comparing the rate of dispersal to methods of sexual selection (polygamy vs. monogamy) to determine the significance of "arbitrary" traits. I'm also developing a mechanism to visualize the full range of ornament on birds, a large part of which we cannot see with our limited visual spectrum. This hyperspectral modeling system will incorporate ultraviolet data (part of the avian color spectrum) into gradient maps of the feather patterns of birds, using tools from Computational Vision &amp; Graphics.</p>
