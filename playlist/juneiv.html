            var description = '<i>18 songs, 1 hour 9 minutes</i><p>"The industrial-age nightmare was that technology would efface the self, but it seems, if anything, to have nurtured a new style of romanticism. The reigning buzzword of our age is &#8217innovation,&#8217 ...its default mode is not sameness but withdrawn, hypersaturated subjectivity. If you want to strut down Broadway to a Gershwin soundtrack, it can be so. If you want to swim the tepid waters of like-minded thought - <i>mon semblable, mon fr&#232re!</i> - technology is your friend. And, should you want to cultivate your introverted consciousness, you can carry a libraryâ€™s worth of books, music, movies, and television with you everywhere you go. To be freed from the stranglehold of Big Media is, instead, to be deluged with a range of online commentary on matters big and small, a thousand click-bait headlines, a million points of irrelevant data presented in a hundred winsome graphic forms. <p> It all works fine until you want to talk about the news with somebody you&#8217ve never met. So, too, with political language. Where customization is the norm, discussion - between strangers and opponents - becomes hard. Negotiation migrates underground, among close affiliates. Publicly, we volley with broad precepts we can all affirm: creativity and kindness are good; cruelty and oppression are bad. Perhaps all this explains how, even when it comes to matters of wide civic concern, a city of progressives can see so little political progress." <p><i>-- Nathan Heller,</i> "California Screaming"';
