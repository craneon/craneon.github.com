An old woman at the window sucked spasmodically at a child&#8217s candy ring. I saw a cat with eyes I would later know from Gina. A woman stopped, looked around, and hiked up her stockings, pinching them through her parka and skirt. I was waiting, as I wandered among stores and children&#8217s carts, for the moment when the twilight would turn eactly the same color as my mother&#8217s gums, and suddenly it did...The silent block made me feel shaken and faint, like a blade plunged into the asphalt and broken off. I stood in the middle of the piata, like a statue of a sad hero, and from my pocket I took the paper thin with age and unwrapped the hideous object. I raised the dentures over my head, and the teeth began to glitter, yellow like a salt flame, while the gums disappeared, melting into the matching color of the evening. &#8217Ah, Mamma,&#8217 I whispered in the crazed silence. I stared at the dentures for a few more minutes in the darkening light, until the dusk turned as scarlet as blood in veins, and the dental appliance began to glow with an interior light, as though a gentle fluroescent gas had filled the curved rubber gums..." <p><i>-- Mircca C&#259;rt&#259;rescu,</i> Blinding';
